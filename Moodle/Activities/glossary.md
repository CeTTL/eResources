## Glossary

The Glossary activity enables participants to create and maintain a list of definitions, like a dictionary, or collect and organise resources and information. Glossaries can be:
 
- A collaborative bank of key terms;
- A ‘getting to know you’ space where new students add their name and personal details;
- A ‘handy tips’ resource of best practice in a practical subject;
- A sharing area of useful videos, images or sound files;
- A revision resource of facts to remember.

1. On the top right hand corner, toggle **Edit mode** on.
