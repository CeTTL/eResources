# How to Upload Recordings to a Panopto Assignment

Follow these steps if you have been asked to submit a Panopto video (or audio) assignment for one of your Moodle papers via a Panopto student assignment folder.

>[!Note]
> This information only covers an older method used before we could upload directly through Moodle. For details on the new method, please see the **[Submit a Panopto assingment](https://www.waikato.ac.nz/students/teaching-and-learning/student/help-with-technology/panopto/panopto-assignments/)** page. Typically, only one method will be available, so check with your lecturer if you're uncertain.

- If you haven’t downloaded Panopto yet, see the **[Download Panopto](https://www.waikato.ac.nz/students/teaching-and-learning/student/help-with-technology/panopto/download-panopto/)** page.
- You can also find information on how to record your assignment directly in Panopto.
- Panopto supports various file types, including: `.wmv`, `.asf`, `.wma`, `.flv`, `.f4v`, `.f4a`, `.mpg`, `.mpeg`, `.mp4`, `.m4a`, `.m4v`, `.3gp`, `.mov`, and `.qt`.
  
Recordings can be made using phones, cameras, video cameras, or webcams. You can also record directly on PowerPoint.
