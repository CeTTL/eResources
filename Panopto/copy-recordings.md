# Copy recordings
> [!IMPORTANT]
> There are 2 types of copy recording: **Full Copy** and **Reference Copy**. You can also add a Panopto recording to a central section of a Moodle paper from your personal folder or from another paper's folder via the new [Panopto video activity](Panopto/add-panopto-video-resource-in-moodle.md) or the [Panopto button in Moodle](Panopto/the-panopto-embed-button.md). 
>
> * If you make a full copy, edits in the copy will not affect the original. This generates a complete copy of the video, devoid of references to the original, enabling independent editing.
> * If you make a reference copy, edits in the copy will be matched in the original. Reference copies are linked to the original source video but have a completely fresh slate of viewer-contributed metadata.
