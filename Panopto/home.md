# Panopto

Panopto enables staff and students to capture and deliver audio and video content. Users are able to record content in lecture theatres as well as from their office or home computer. Panopto is integrated with Moodle which makes it easy for lecturers to create recordings that are automatically available to students within the Moodle course.  

Recordings can also be viewed directly from [our Panopto server](https://waikato.au.panopto.com/) and where required MP3 and/or MP4 versions can be downloaded.

After you complete a Panopto recording, there is a period of processing time.  As a general rule of thumb, if a recording is **one hour long**, it will take **one further hour** to process before it is available to students in the Panopto block of the Moodle paper.

> ## New Panopto tools in Moodle
> We have added a Panopto Video activity and a Panopto Assignment activity to the latest version of Moodle. [A Panopto button](the-panopto-embed-button.md) is also available in the Moodle text editor, allowing you to add Panopto content to most sections of your Moodle papers.
