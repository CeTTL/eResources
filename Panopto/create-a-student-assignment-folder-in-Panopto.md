# Create a Student Assignment Folder in Panopto

You can create a folder in Panopto where students can record or upload video or audio for an assignment.

Students will need to follow the **Student Learning > Help with Technology > Panopto > [Submit a Panopto assingment](https://www.waikato.ac.nz/students/teaching-and-learning/student/help-with-technology/panopto/panopto-assignments/)** documentation.

Accepted file types include: `.wmv`, `.asf`, `.wma`, `.flv`, `.f4v`, `.f4a`, `.mpg`, `.mpeg`, `.mp4`, `.m4a`, `.m4v`, `.3gp`, `.mov`, `.qt`.

>[!Note]
The **Submit a Panopto assingment** online documentation for students only covers the new tools to avoid confusion. Students are advised: “If your lecturer has asked you to upload an assignment using another method, please [contact the e-Tuts](https://www.waikato.ac.nz/students/teaching-and-learning/student/the-etuts-team/) for help.”
>A page outlining this method is available to share with students. Please include this link in your instructions and test the link: [How to upload a Panopto assignment](/CeTTL/eResources/Panopto/how-to-upload-recordings-to-a-Panopto-assignment.md)
