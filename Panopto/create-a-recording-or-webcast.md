> [!NOTE]
> You can **Pause** the recording and **Start** again when ready. Recording continues in the background and can usually be retrieved in editing, if you remember to **Stop** the recording to save it.

10. Select **Delete and record again** if you are not happy with your recording and want to re-do it, or **Upload** if it is fine.

> [!NOTE]
> After selecting **Upload**, the recording will be first uploaded to the Panopto database, then processed before being made available for viewing, editing and sharing. You can log out after the upload is complete (make sure to not log out before), the processing will not be affected. The processing time may take up to a few hours.
