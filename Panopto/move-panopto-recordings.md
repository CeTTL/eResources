# Move Panopto recordings

> * Follow these steps to move a Zoom session recording from your personal My Folder to the Panopto block of a Moodle paper, or  other recordings from one of your Panopto folders to another.
> * You can also use the new [Panopto Video resource](add-panopto-video-resource-in-moodle.md) or the [Panopto embed button](the-panopto-embed-button.md) in Moodle to add a Panopto recording to a section of a Moodle paper, either from your personal folder or from another paper folder.
