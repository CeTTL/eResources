# Student assignments

There is a new <a href="https://www.waikato.ac.nz/students/eresources/moodle/assignments/panopto-assignments/" target="_blank">Panopto assignment</a> tool that you can add via the Add an activity or resource menu in Moodle. The Moodle plugin manages all the creation and permission settings and assignments can be graded.

?> If you prefer to create a student assignment folder via Panopto, using the previous method, see the [Staff and student Panopto student folder instructions pdf](Create-student-assignment-folder-old-method.pdf). This method is useful if you would like students to share multiple files, or you want them to upload videos for non-assignment purposes.

Please see also: 

- The Panopto assignment grading page for differences between Panopto assignment grading and standard Moodle grading.
