# Activities

Moodle Activities are items that students can contribute to directly, added by the teacher via the **Add an activity or resource** menu.

We have created some step-by-step instructions for the most common tasks people ask us about. Please [**let us know**](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=w10PIlKU5UibT4iN9C96LV3bzK2GZptAs5fkk10ScINURDA0NFdRTlNETDhISE81STNGU0VHREhYMyQlQCN0PWcu) if there are other step-by-step instructions you would like us to create.

Log on to Moodle at [https://elearn.waikato.ac.nz](https://elearn.waikato.ac.nz/)

**Moodle and Panopto are unavailable every Thursday 7:00 am â€“ 7:30 am.**
